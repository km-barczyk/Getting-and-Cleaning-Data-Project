### Merge training and test sets

Test and training data (X_train.txt, X_test.txt), subject ids (subject_train.txt,
subject_test.txt) and activity ids (y_train.txt, y_test.txt) are merged to obtain
a single data set. Variables are labelled with the names assigned by original
collectors (features.txt).

### Extract mean and standard deviation variables

From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the
values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain "mean") and standard
deviation (variables with labels that contain "std").

### Use descriptive activity names

A new column is added to intermediate data set with the activity description.
Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.

### Label variables appropriately

Labels given from the original collectors were changed:
* to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas
* to obtain more descriptive labels

### Create a tidy data set

From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric
variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.
